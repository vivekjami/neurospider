# NeuroSpider

A high-performance, AI-powered web crawling platform built in Rust.

## Overview

NeuroSpider combines distributed crawling with machine learning to deliver intelligent, scalable web data acquisition. Built from the ground up in Rust for memory safety and performance.

## Features (Planned)

- **High-Performance Crawling**: Asynchronous, distributed architecture
- **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Content quality scoring and crawl optimization  
- **Security-First**: End-to-end encryption and audit trails
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-ready with auto-scaling
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple APIs and comprehensive documentation

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development** - Project structure and core components in progress.

### Completed
- [x] Project planning and architecture design
- [ ] Core workspace setup
- [ ] HTTP client implementation
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] AI/ML pipeline
- [ ] Security framework
- [ ] API development
- [ ] Web interface
