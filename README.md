# NeuroSpider - Day 1 Foundation Setup

This is the Day 1 foundation setup for NeuroSpider, a next-generation AI-powered web crawling platform built in Rust.

```

## Day 1 Accomplishments

- ✅ Cargo workspace with 2 core crates
- ✅ Basic project structure and organization
- ✅ Development tooling (rustfmt, clippy, CI)
- ✅ Essential dependencies configuration
- ✅ Error handling foundation
- ✅ Testing infrastructure

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Install development tools
cargo install cargo-watch cargo-audit
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Validate the setup
make validate

# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make lint

# Watch for changes during development
make dev

# Build the project
make build

# Generate documentation
make docs
```

## What's Next (Day 2+)

The foundation is now ready for:
- Security framework implementation
- Database integration (FoundationDB)
- Message queue setup (Apache Pulsar)
- HTTP client implementation
- Advanced observability

## Architecture Notes

This Day 1 setup establishes:
- **Memory-safe foundation** with Rust
- **Modular crate structure** for scalability
- **Type-safe error handling** with thiserror
- **Async-first architecture** with Tokio
- **Quality assurance** with automated testing and linting

The workspace is configured to support the full enterprise-scale platform while maintaining simplicity for the initial development phases.
