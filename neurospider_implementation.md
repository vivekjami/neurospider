# NeuroSpider: Technical Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
- **Crawler Engine**: Rust service for HTTP requests, proxy management, and basic anti-detection
- **AI Extraction Service**: Python service using OpenAI API for content extraction when CSS selectors fail
- **API Gateway**: FastAPI service with authentication and basic rate limiting
- **Task Queue**: Redis-based async job processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for caching

### Realistic Data Flow
1. API receives extraction request and validates input
2. Job queued in Redis with retry logic
3. Rust crawler fetches page through proxy rotation
4. Python service attempts rule-based extraction first, falls back to AI if confidence <80%
5. Results validated against expected schema, cached, and returned
6. Basic metrics collected for monitoring

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Month 1 - Budget: $25)

### Technical Scope
- Extract product data from 3 major sites: Amazon, Shopify demo store, one custom e-commerce site
- Single DigitalOcean droplet deployment
- SQLite database (no infrastructure costs)
- Basic proxy rotation (datacenter proxies: $0.30/IP)
- OpenAI API integration with strict usage limits

### Core Crawler Engine (Rust)
```rust
use reqwest::Client;
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

pub struct SimpleCrawler {
    client: Client,
    proxy_list: Vec<String>,
    current_proxy: usize,
}

impl SimpleCrawler {
    pub async fn fetch_page(&mut self, url: &str) -> Result<String, CrawlError> {
        // Basic implementation - no magic
        let response = self.client
            .get(url)
            .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
            .send()
            .await?;
            
        if response.status().is_success() {
            Ok(response.text().await?)
        } else {
            Err(CrawlError::HttpError(response.status()))
        }
    }
}
```

### AI Integration Reality Check
```python
import openai
import json
from typing import Optional, Dict

class ProductExtractor:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = openai.AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key)
        self.monthly_budget = 5.0  # Strict cost control
        self.current_spend = 0.0
    
    async def extract_product(self, html: str, url: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        if self.current_spend >= self.monthly_budget:
            return None  # Budget exhausted
            
        # Simple extraction prompt - no complex reasoning
        prompt = f"""Extract product information from this HTML:
        {html[:2000]}  # Limit tokens to control costs
        
        Return JSON with: name, price, description, availability
        Return null if this is not a product page."""
        
        try:
            response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Cheaper than GPT-4
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                max_tokens=200,  # Strict limit
                temperature=0
            )
            
            self.current_spend += 0.002  # Approximate cost tracking
            return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
            
        except Exception as e:
            return None  # Fail gracefully
```

### Database Schema (Start Simple)
```sql
-- Minimal viable schema
CREATE TABLE extraction_jobs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    error_message TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE extracted_products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id INTEGER REFERENCES extraction_jobs(id),
    name TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    description TEXT,
    availability TEXT,
    confidence_score REAL,
    extraction_method TEXT, -- 'ai' or 'rules'
    raw_data JSONB
);
```

### API Design (FastAPI)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl
import asyncio

app = FastAPI(title="NeuroSpider API", version="0.1.0")

class ExtractionRequest(BaseModel):
    url: HttpUrl
    callback_url: Optional[HttpUrl] = None

class ExtractionResponse(BaseModel):
    job_id: int
    status: str
    estimated_completion: Optional[datetime]

@app.post("/extract/product", response_model=ExtractionResponse)
async def extract_product(request: ExtractionRequest):
    # Queue job, return immediately
    job_id = await queue_extraction_job(request.url)
    return ExtractionResponse(
        job_id=job_id, 
        status="queued",
        estimated_completion=datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=2)
    )
```

## Phase 2: Customer Validation (Month 2-3 - Budget: $150)

### Infrastructure Upgrade Triggers
- Upgrade to managed PostgreSQL only after 3+ paying customers
- Add Redis only when job queue becomes bottleneck
- Kubernetes deployment only when single droplet hits resource limits

### Advanced Features (Customer-Driven)
- Add sites based on customer requests, not assumptions
- Implement webhooks only if customers ask for real-time updates
- Build dashboard only if API-only approach proves insufficient

### Realistic Success Metrics
- 90%+ extraction accuracy (95% is optimistic for diverse sites)
- <2 second response time (including AI processing)
- 99% uptime (single droplet with monitoring)
- $50+ MRR to justify continued development

## Phase 3: Production Readiness (Month 4-6 - Budget: $300)

### Infrastructure Evolution
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment - when actually needed
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: neurospider-crawler
spec:
  replicas: 2  # Start small
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: crawler
        image: neurospider/crawler:v1
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"  # Realistic limits
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
        env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-credentials
              key: url
```

### Monitoring (Essential, Not Impressive)
```rust
use tracing::{info, error, instrument};

#[instrument]
async fn crawl_page(url: &str) -> Result<String, CrawlError> {
    let start = std::time::Instant::now();
    
    match fetch_with_retries(url, 3).await {
        Ok(content) => {
            info!(
                url = %url,
                duration_ms = start.elapsed().as_millis(),
                "Page crawled successfully"
            );
            Ok(content)
        },
        Err(e) => {
            error!(
                url = %url,
                error = %e,
                "Failed to crawl page"
            );
            Err(e)
        }
    }
}
```

## Real Technical Challenges

### Anti-Detection Limitations
Modern bot detection is sophisticated. Residential proxies help but aren't magic. Expect:
- 70-80% success rate on protected sites initially
- Continuous arms race requiring ongoing adaptation
- Higher proxy costs as traffic scales ($3-5/GB for quality residential)

### AI Extraction Reality
- GPT-3.5/4 works well for obvious product pages
- Fails on complex layouts, non-English content, heavily JavaScript-rendered pages
- Costs can spiral: 1000 extractions might cost $2-5 depending on content length
- Latency adds up: 200-800ms per AI call

### Infrastructure Scaling Costs
```
Month 1: $25  (1 droplet + minimal proxy)
Month 3: $75  (managed DB + more proxy traffic)
Month 6: $150 (Kubernetes + high-availability setup)
Month 12: $300+ (multi-region, enterprise features)
```

## Honest Success Probability

### High Probability Outcomes
- Build working product that demonstrates technical skills
- Gain real experience with Rust, Kubernetes, AI APIs
- Create portfolio project worth discussing in interviews
- Learn about product development and customer validation

### Medium Probability Outcomes
- Acquire 5-10 paying customers by month 6
- Generate $150-500 MRR sustained over 3+ months
- Build small community around open source components
- Get acquisition interest from larger players

### Low Probability Outcomes
- Scale to $5K+ MRR within 12 months
- Compete directly with established enterprise players
- Achieve the "10M+ pages daily" processing claims
- Replace existing solutions for most customers

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **Proxy detection**: Sites adapt faster than anti-detection measures
- **AI costs**: Usage-based pricing can exceed budget quickly
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Rust expertise curve steeper than expected
- **Site changes**: Extraction accuracy degrades over time without maintenance

### Market Risks
- **Customer acquisition**: Developer tools have long sales cycles
- **Price sensitivity**: Small businesses may prefer free alternatives
- **Competition**: Established players could add AI features faster
- **Regulatory**: Web scraping legality varies by jurisdiction and use case

### Execution Risks
- **Scope creep**: Feature requests from early customers
- **Technical debt**: Pressure to ship fast vs maintain code quality
- **Solo development**: No team to catch mistakes or share workload
- **Burnout**: 6-month intensive project while job searching

## Mitigation Strategies

### Technical
- Start with 3 well-understood sites before expanding
- Implement comprehensive testing from day one
- Use existing libraries where possible (playwright, scrapy patterns)
- Plan for AI fallback to rule-based extraction

### Business
- Validate customer willingness to pay before building
- Focus on specific use case rather than general crawling
- Price at market rates, not below-market rates
- Build email list before product launch

### Personal
- Set weekly time limits to prevent burnout
- Define clear stopping criteria for each phase
- Maintain job search activities parallel to development
- Document everything for portfolio value regardless of business outcome

## Honest Assessment

This project could work as a portfolio accelerator and learning vehicle. The technical choices are sound and align with target company requirements. The business potential exists but is uncertain.

The key insight is treating this as a **portfolio project that might become a business** rather than a **business that happens to be good for portfolios**. This mindset keeps expectations realistic while maximizing learning and interview preparation value.

Success should be measured by whether you can confidently discuss distributed systems, AI integration, and production deployment challenges in interviews, not just by revenue numbers.

The technical foundation is solid. The execution plan is realistic. The market validation approach is correct. Whether it succeeds as a business depends on execution quality and market factors beyond your control.
